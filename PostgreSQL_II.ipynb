        "SQL allows us to transform and aggregate our data hence making queries more efficient and results more meaningful. Aggregations work down column and not across rows. Below are some of the aggregation functions that we can use in SQL:\n",
        "*   `COUNT` -- counts how many rows are in a particular column\n",
        "*   `SUM` -- adds up all the values in a particular column\n",
        "*   `MIN`  -- returns the minimun value in a particular column\n",
        "*   `MAX`  -- returns the maximun value in a particular column\n",
        "*   `AVERAGE` -- calculates the average in a particular column\n",
